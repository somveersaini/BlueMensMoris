    <string name="shortdesc">A NP-Hard problem\nBeat the DFS based approach</string>
    <string name="details">The game proceeds in three phases:\n
    Placing men on vacant points\n
        In this phase, you have to place all your pieces on board.\n\n
    Moving men to adjacent points\n
        In this you can only move to valid moves on board.\n\n
    (optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when a player has been reduced to three men\n
        After your pieces, reduced to three you can move to any position available.\n\n
         if you get the mill, you can pick a piece of opponent.\n\n
